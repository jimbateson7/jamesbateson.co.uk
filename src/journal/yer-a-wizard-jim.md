Last week I visited the Harry Potter studio tour! It's something I have had on bucket list for a while and lived in up to expectations. But most importantly, with the house and job stress, such. Exactly the distraction and boost I needed.\
\
The idea was suggested many months ago, and I'm so glad we saw it through.\
\
One thing I took for the experince and that I am thankful for is that with looking for job and then having the double whammy of having to look for a new place to live, is that it doesn't matter.\
\
This might sound wild, and I still have these problems after the weekend away. But for this weekend I forgot about this, I went back to my childhood self, embraced and enjoyed the expreince.
