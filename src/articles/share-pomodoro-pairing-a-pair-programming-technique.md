Pair programming is a useful way to create an open and collaborative feedback and learning development environment. Finding the right workflow and most effective pairing can vary from person to person and team to team.

One technique I've always enjoyed and a brilliant article I often go back to and reference to others is from [Katy Raby: Pomodoro Pairing - a pair programming technique](https://www.katieraby.com/blog/pomodoro-pairing).

From the article:

> ## The pomodoro steps
>
> 1. Decide on a task
> 2. Set the pomodoro timer (25 mins, adapt to suit)
> 3. Work on the task
> 4. When the timer finishes, take a short break (typically 5 mins)
> 5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you've done 3 or 4 pomodoros
> 6. Take a longer break

I would recommend reading the article on Katy's site, as there is more background and information on the technique and a nice tool recommendation for keeping to the times as well.

It's something I'll be sharing when moving into my next role.
