This week I saw a [post on Linkedin from Karl Groves](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7226572726415601664/). He posts daily accessibility tips which are always insighful and helpful.

Here Karl talks about how customising the browser scrollbar can cause accessibility and usability issues. For example, failing colour contrast and potentially leading to people not realising there is content that can be scrolled.

Another little note to myself here so that I don't lose it, but also wanted to pull a quote out from it that resonated with something that I have always advocated for:

> Remember: the web content might be yours, but the browser belongs to the user.
