			<h2>Speaking and Writing</h2>
			<p>I am passionate about speaking and writing on a variety of topics. Particularly around accessibility, front-end development and mental health.</p>
			<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section is a little bit work in progress. Some items may link to video recordings or articles, some to slides and some just provide a summary of the talk/post and where it took place/was for. I'll aim to make this more consistent in the future.</p>
